        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          An aspiring Cyber Security specialist looking for an entry level
          job within the tech industry to start my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in the technical element of crime. I continuously strive to
          be the best person I can be, and this is why I have completed many
          certifications surrounding code programming and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I volunteer a lot of my time with the Royal Air Force Air Cadets. 
          <br>
          From 2016-2022 I gained many skills as a cadet reaching the rank of
          Flight Sergeant. Whilst a Cadet I achieved many awards, such as Mayors
          Cadet in 2021/22, and gained lots of experience such as volunteering
          at RIAT in 2018. The most useful skills I have learnt from the cadets
          include: the ability to speak effectively in front of large audiences;
          organise my time; and lead teams to success, noticeably the NCO teams
          I have developed and the ILM level 2 Young Leaders qualification I
          hained in 2018. For the past 6 months I have been a Civilian Instructor
          within the cadets where I have taken an active role in the development
          of the Cadet Non-Commissioned Officers on the squadron; training them
          to lead, communicate and work efficiently as a team.

<!-- Found a small bug that as the "KeySkillsSection" was the bottom of the page... It did not
     format the text "scrollIntoView" element nicely. Took a while to get the correct amount for the page
     It does make the CV look rather odd. Don't know if I should remove the Breaks? Just wanted to be clear it worked.
